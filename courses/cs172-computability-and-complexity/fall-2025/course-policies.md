## Course Policies and Information

Format

Lectures will be in-person at 110 - Social Sciences Buildingon Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12:30 to 2:00 PM.

We encourage you to attend lectures and to participate during lectures. Lecture recordings will be posted regularly and might be a good resource for material review.

Discussion sections will be in person. Unless mentioned otherwise, the two discussion sections will cover the same material.

Prerequisites

CS170 (or equivalent) is a prerequisite to this course. In some cases, we will allow taking CS170 in parallel to CS172 -- please contact the instructor for approval in such a case.

Grading & Exams

The final grade will be composed as follows:

- 25% homework

- 20% first midterm - Oct 2, 7-9P, Mulford Hall, Room 159

- 20% second midterm - Nov 4, 7-9P, Evans 60

- 35% final exam - Fri, Dec 19,8:00-11:00AM, Exam Location TBD
Homework

There will be 11 homework problem sets. When calculating the homework average, we will drop the bottom 2 grades,whichcan be used only in the last 7 problem sets (i.e., no drops in the first 4 problem sets). We will not allow automatic slip days, but will allow a grace period of up to 2 hours for each submission. In case you are under special circumstances that require more time, please contact the course staff, and we'll do our best to accommodate. During the weeks preceding the two midterms, we will not hand out homework problems to allow you to study for the midterms.

We encourage you to start working on the homework early. We'll hold office hours and homework parties regularly -- you are encouraged to use these resources to ask questions and form study groups.

Homework should be either typed (e.g., in Word or preferably in LaTeX) or written legibly and scanned. We'll provide a LaTex template that you can use.

Textbook

The required textbook for the course is "Introduction to the Theory of Computation" by Michael Sipser. Most readings will be from the textbook, and the relevant chapters for each lecture will be mentioned on the [Lecture Schedule](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u7MJUPbMGMED6z1xUB49WxcO42fR7kJuD9HeJRzR0ng) page.

Office Hours

The Instructor and GSI will hold weekly office hours. Office hours are an excellent opportunity to engage with course staff and ask questions about the material.

Collaboration

The guiding principle for homework collaboration is that your write-up of the solutions should be yours only. You are encouraged to work together in small study groups, where it is fine to discuss the meaning of a problem and ways to solve it; however, you must always write up the solutions on your own. Similarly, you may use books and other sources to help solve homework problems, but you must write up the solution on your own and cite any sources you use.

You should be aware that copying or sharing solutions, in whole or in part, from other students in the class (or any other source without acknowledgment) constitutes cheating. For more information, please see the [Department's policy on Academic Dishonesty](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/students/academic-misconduct/).

If youâ€™re ever in doubt about what constitutes academic dishonesty, please ask course staff or post on Ed.

Conflicts

We do allow time conflicts, but not for exams.

Climate & Incident Reporting

The department is maintaining an [Incident Reporting Form](http://eecs.link/climate) that students can use if they feel unsafe, disrespected, or unwelcome. You are encouraged to use it if this applies to you (in this class or elsewhere on campus)
